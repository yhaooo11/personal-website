        <p>
            Hey! I'm Yifan Hao, a computer science and statistics student at the University of British Columbia. I am currently
            doing a co-op term at Verto Health as a full stack developer.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I love solving problems and learning. As a full stack developer, I have skills in a variety of areas and technologies.
            Currently, I am using technologies such as Vue.js, Angular, Ruby on Rails, and Python to develop products that solve
            healthcare's biggest and most complicated problems.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me playing/watching basketball, cooking, hiking, or feeding in a game of 
            League of Legends.
        </p>
