            Hey! I'm Yifan, a computer science and statistics student at the University of British Columbia. I am currently working as a software engineering intern 
            at Sony Pictures Imageworks on the infrastructure team.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I love solving problems and learning. As an inspiring software engineer, I have developed my skills in a variety of areas
            and technolgies. Most recently, I have been learning more about data engineering using technolgies like Kafka, Spark, Python, and SQL.
            I've also been honing my C++ skills through my personal projects.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me playing/watching basketball, cooking, hiking, or just lying in my bed.
